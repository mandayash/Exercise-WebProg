                    <h2>
                        The Desert Farming Revival Feeding Thousands in Rajasthan</h2>
                        <h4>The Bhils of Jaisalmer, once labourers, have reclaimed prosperity through the revival of
                        'khadeens,' transforming land they once thought barren.</h4>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1994, Ghazi Ram was covered in sand from head to toe, parched with thirst. Armed with
                        a spade and stick, he had spent hours clearing the roads for Indian Army convoys in Rajasthan’s
                        Jaisalmer district. The desert landscape, notorious for its relentless month-long sandstorms,
                        frequently blocked the paths and wheels of the convoy.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">That day, Ram’s pocket was heavy with sand, and the coins that made up his meager
                        wage of 10 rupees barely made a sound. The 70-year-old farmer belongs to the Bhil
                        tribe, an indigenous community in Rajasthan that once lived in forests and relied on
                        hunting for survival. The Bhils worshipped Lord Shiva, among other deities.</p>
                            
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">By 2006, Ram had returned to his village, Ekal Par, located about 60 kilometres
                        from the Indo-Pak border. Over the next three years, he dedicated himself to reviving
                        khadeen, his ancestral land. No longer a labourer, he reclaimed the traditional knowledge
                        that had once been lost with the destruction of the khadeens.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Khadeens are desert lands cultivated using an ancient
                        method that harnesses the natural, balanced cycles of the year. This traditional
                        practice is known as "khadeen farming."

                        "Neither my father, nor did I know what to do with this land [19 hectares]
                        until 2006 when Chhatar Singh taught me that if revived, I could cultivate it,"
                        Ram told FairPlanet, adding that he did not believe in the idea that a land in the
                        desert could grow crops and vegetables. </p>

                         <p style="text-align: justify;">Chhatar Singh, a 63-year-old conservationist, has dedicated
                        over 40 years of his life to reviving khadeens. He did so along with the Sambhaav Trust, a
                        local NGO. He encouraged farmers to reconnect with the natural cycles of the desert and empowered
                        them to embrace ancient wisdom.
                        It is through the khadeens that the people of this region have been able to survive the
                        harsh climate and an annual rainfall of just 100mm.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Traditionally, crops are never manually irrigated. In winter, the cold
                    topsoil and the warmth of the earth below cause the stored water to evaporate, providing natural
                    moisture to the plant roots.
